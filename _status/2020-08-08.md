Stay-Home-Notice Day 3.


I feel like I am undergoing a sociological experiment of Pavlov. Every time I heard noise outside my door, I was wondering if there comes my meal and would like to check it out immediately.


Need to equip my calendar with more challenging workload. I am kinda tired of days of doing nothing.
