It's an article to note some problems when building my VPS. It has been a long time since the last time I use similar tools. But now I am home - So .. for a more convenient working env!

### Just Use CentOS

Since I have a special affection for Ubuntu. So I created a Ubuntu system as my server. When I tried to `yam` there I got a not found. Turn out that `yam` is only belong to CentOS. (It can be installed in Ubuntu but a little complex) This is the first time I know this.😇

### Secure My Login

And I got 3035 failed login attempt during my dinner.. whatt happend!! I think I need to configure a SSH to make it more secure. Beacuse this is so scary...

I referred to the Digital Ocean's tutorial[1] to config one!

Basically first make it only allow login with specific username in specific port number.

> When you perform any root tasks with the new user, you will need to use the phrase “sudo” before the command. This is a helpful command for 2 reasons: 1) it prevents the user from making any system-destroying mistakes 2) it stores all the commands run with sudo to the file ‘/var/log/secure' which can be reviewed later if needed.

After setting a new port, I got a 'Connection timed out' when ssh to my server with `ssh -p [PORT] [USERNAME]@[IP_ADDRESS]`. AND! Also with `ssh [USERNAME]@[IP_ADDRESS]`! Which means the default port also becomes unconnectable.

The problem is: edit the configuration file is not enough. We also need to update the `iptables`! And also remember to save and **restart** it!

This Operation: flush make me confuse for a little more while.

Flush when complete the sshd_config update.

```shell
    sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    # Edit the config file
    service sshd reload
```

Then also need to flush after saving your iptables.

```shell
    # iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2333 -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables
    service iptables restart
```

Even when you see your updates in `iptables -L -n` - it doesn't means the port can now be accessd.

To automate the restore at reboot CentOS offers a system service by the same name, iptables. However, it does not come in the default configuration and needs to be installed manually. So when I try to `service iptables save`, only to find 'The service command supports only basic LSB actions' before I install that cuz some tutorial use it without consciousness. Thanks to UpCloud's article[2] for telling me this. 

Some cmd needed:

Show iptables:

    iptables -L -n

Add firewall rules:

    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2333 -j ACCEPT

Saving iptables:

    sudo iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables

Then I can finally use my port to ssh my server.


Using Trojan have to open HTTP port 80 & HTTPS 443.

Similarly, RHEL/CentOS version 6.x or above can:

    iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT


BTW, after `service iptables restart` the `iptables -L -n` will show nothing. But things will still be saved in config file.

Iptables rules will no longer be implemented by default, so a reboot will result in them disappearing. You can then simply restore the saved rules by reading the file you saved.

    # Overwrite the current rules
    sudo iptables-restore < /etc/sysconfig/iptables
    # Add the new rules keeping the current ones
    sudo iptables-restore -n < /etc/sysconfig/iptables

    # I saved them in /etc/my-iptables-rules
    iptables-save > /etc/my-iptables-rules

So a regular rule can be add into `/etc/rc.local`:   
    
    iptables-restore -n < /etc/my-iptables-rules

that prevent me from restore it every time reboot the server.

### Domain Settings

Point domain to my VPS have several options[3], I chose to add 2 A records (@ & www) pointing to my VPS IP.

### Access Problems

When running an install shell script, I found Trojan can not read its `config.json`...

After checking the log, I simply chmod the permissions of the whole folder since I am the only user of my server.

    sudo chmod -R 777 foldername

`-R` means recursively. So everything inside can be accessed. 


### Setup FTP

Also need to do this one day.
