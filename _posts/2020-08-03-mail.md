第一章：思路篇：精，礼，准，行，谢 英语邮件的五字方针在开始正式内容之前，还是希望帮大家提炼一下撰写英语邮件的要领：一封好的英语邮件我认为有5个重要标准：1.精：措辞言简意赅，篇幅精简，因为邮件的目的是方便别人阅读和理解。（LESS IS MORE）2.礼：一定要讲礼节，讲礼节，讲礼节！重要的事情讲3遍。外国人非常讲究礼貌，这代表一个人的素养，尤其在素未谋面的情况下。礼貌的态度就是你最好得名片。3.准：表达的信息，观点要明确。每每都要击中要害，就如同一颗颗出膛的子弹击中你所要表达的目的。（bullet point）抓重点，不要泛泛而谈。因为人家没时间看你的“文章”。一般重要信息有，【重要决定】，【会议纪要】，【建议&方案】等一般选取三点比较好，提炼关键点。1，2，3，我只说三点4.行：“行“表示邮件最后要给到下一步的行动计划，因为光有一个结论没有action plan等于没有推动项目的进行。所以给到邮件相关同事，客户一个清晰的行动计划，最好用表格的形式呈现为上策。记住，你是一个手握方向盘的老司机，你要drive。开车5.谢：在邮件最后，表达感谢。希望别人的回复，感谢他人的配合与协作。带着满满都诚意与他人沟通，合作就会变得顺畅。让别人不仅仅知道你的目的，更重要的是你的心意。希望你通过以上五个bullet point配合我提供的一些模版，还有自己的积累。写出一封封得体又温暖的英语邮件。让你的沟通帮助你赢得生意场上的丰收，获得公司内部沟通达人的好口碑。第二章：实用篇奉上独家使用说明书：1.保存一个word文档，需要的话下方有获取方式2.“查找”你需要的主题或者关键字 （CTRL+F）3.复制+粘贴：应该是最喜闻乐见的快捷键了4.修改润色：根据你邮件需要表达的意思和语境进行适当的修改好句子都在下面了，供大家参考： 以下例句均来自Talaera——一个英语机构《150+ Useful Email Phrases That Will Make Your Life Easier》原文链接：https://blog.talaera.com/business-emails-phrases原作者：Paola Pascual在此基础上进行二次整理～分成：1.凤头 2.猪肚 3.豹尾 就像小时候学写作文一样 一 凤头A.

Feel free to let me know if there could be any questions.     Nice weekend ！补充：关于英语邮件中附件的小心得：写邮件时需要集中精力，因为在邮件中的每个字，每句话所传达的信息都代表着个人或者公司的立场。所以一定要慎重，反复检查。附件作为邮件中的关键信息，更是要加以重视。因为，附件一般包含“报价，合同，商务策划案，文稿”等重要商业信息。所以，结合以往的工作经验，给到一些tips。1.附件审批：若涉及合同，报价等重要文件，一定要先和上级领导提前sign-off，确认内容时准确无误后再加入到邮件内。2.附件的文件名：附件的文件名记得要针对收件人进行优化，应该具有很强的识别性，好的文件名是“当对方下载后不需要重命名的”，直接放在文件夹保存。虽然是很小的一个细节，但是能体现你工作的温度，你是在为下一个接手的人（同事，客户）着想的。3.发送前检查我在发送线一般都会检查至少两遍，一般检查两个点：a.附件是否有被添加，数量是否正确b.点击预览，看文件是否能够打开c.再次查看附件的内容，尤其是报价和合同，我会整体再检查一遍4.点击发送自信的点击发送，耐心等待回复
