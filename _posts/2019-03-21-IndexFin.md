    PS Y:\Blog> git push origin gh-pages

    fatal: HttpRequestException encountered.
        发送请求时出错。
    Username for 'https://github.com': timothyhay
    Password for 'https://timothyhay@github.com':
    To https://github.com/Timothyhay/TimothyhayHeap.git
        ! [rejected]      gh-pages -> gh-pages (fetch first)
    error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Timothyhay/TimothyhayHeap.git'
    hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
    hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
    hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
    hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
    hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

解决方法是：

    git pull --rebase origin gh-pages

    git push -u origin gh-pages
